# chaosGame

Generate Fractals using the chaos game. 

Some different fractals can be generated, such as the Sierpinski triangle and the Barnsley Fern through the command line.

# Dependencies

This repository is standalone. The only dependency is graphics.py which is also included for convenience.

# System requirements 

The only requirement is a working version of Python 2 and that the operating system provides 
the neccessary components for graphics.py.

# An Example. A Fancy Fractal
